Checking whether two nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) accept the same
language is important in many application domains such as compiler construction and model checking. 
Unfortunately, solving this problem is costly: it is
PSPACE-complete (TODO cita)

In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Bonchi0K17}, up-to techniques are defined for
weighted systems over arbitrary semirings, while in \cite{BONCHI201277}, up-to techniques
are defined for Linear Weighted Automata (LWAs), under a more abstract coalgebraic perspective.

A well detailed example of the comparison of algorithms to compute 
language equivalence, precisely between \texttt{HKC} and an alternative
algorithm called the \textit{antichain algorithm} (\cite{de2006antichains}),
was published in 2017 \cite{fu2017equivalence}.
